# PfDA_Project


## Project Description

Create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing. Then, rather than collect data related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python. We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose.

## Project Name

Quantifying Military Expenditure and Analysising some of the key variables such as Total Spending, GDP and Per Capita  

## Link to Jupyter Notebook

[GITHUB LINK] https://github.com/KenLin765/PfDA_Project/blob/main/Main.ipynb

## Installation

I have included all the code and the Main.ipynb code. I have used a jupyter notebook and then displayed the output on the same page for graphs or information on the dataset.

I have included the main libraries that I have used at the top of the page.

These libraries are: 

[Numpy] https://numpy.org/ 

[Pandas] https://pandas.pydata.org/

[Seaborn] https://seaborn.pydata.org/

[Matplotlib] https://matplotlib.org/

I have included links for further info if needed.

I have also included 3 excel sheets in the data folder on: 

[github] https://github.com/KenLin765/PfDA_Project/tree/main/data

If you are using my code, you may have to amend the pathways in order to make this work in reading for numpy.
