    "- Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.\n",
    "- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.\n",

    "- Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.\n",
